## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently enrolled @ Western Colorado University... pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a Software Engineering Emphasis and Music Technology Minor.

I love planning and developing apps/programs from the ground up! Java, C++, and Kotlin are my favorite languages so far.

Currently working on...
- Java + JavaFX -- Point of Sale System
- Rust -- Simple Black Jack Game
- Kotlin -- Artist Gallery App
